# Networking Hullabaloo
This is now a serious project made by serious men

# Running
The main hub is in server/server.go .
To run it do `go run server/server.js` (we may make binaries some day :) )

Now fire up the client with `go run client/client.go`. Connect to it from the browser at
`http://localhost:8080` and enter
the ip of the hub when prompted.
