# Networking Hullabaloo
This is now a serious project made by serious men 

# Installing
We are currently using a makeshift websocket server and client
made in node js  
But that'll _hopefully_ change soon.


## Dependencies
* **golang**        (https://golang.org)
* **node.js**       (https://nodejs.org)
    * ws (websocket server)


## Instructions
cd to the folder where this is stored
and run `npm install` to install dependencies

# Running
To run the server do `node server.js` in the server folder

To run the client just run any http server.
( I have personally been using `python -m http.server` (for python 3) in the folder client/apps )
and then connect to it from your browser
